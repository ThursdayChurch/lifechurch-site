      <p>Through this interactive campus event, you will examine your core values, spiritual gifts, and past experiences. These three areas will help you identify common themes, bring clarity to your unique passions, and lead you to the purpose God has for just for you. The best part is that you can start planning your next steps toward pursuing God's vision–or chazown–for your life.</
