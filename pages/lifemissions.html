      <p>Communities aren't changed by programs but by relationships developed among the people in that community. In our missions work, we build and support relationships that inspire change.</p>

      <p>To get involved, you can build relationships by volunteering with our local mission partners. You can also support relationships worldwide by giving to our global partners. When you give beyond your tithe to Relief and Restoration at Thursday Church, you provide disaster relief and support restorative relationships throughout the world.</p>

      <h2>HOPE International</h2>
      <p>HOPE International focuses on alleviating physical and spiritual poverty through microenterprise development in 16 countries around the world.</p>
      <p>HOPE International programs provide Christ-centered microfinance and savings, along with education. Microfinance isn't a handout but a hand-up. It requires ownership and active participation from the beneficiaries. Microloan recipients can take pride in knowing that their own hard work has made the difference between poverty and provision for their families.</p>
      <p>Thursday Church provides support to Hope International’s global work.</p>
