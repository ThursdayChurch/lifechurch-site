      <p>Have you ever thought that helping others could actually hurt them? Without the right approach, we can start with good intentions, but end up hurting those we want to help the most. At Thursday Church, we're learning to think differently about missions and we want you to be part of that conversation through Restore.</p>

      <p>Restore is a three-session, documentary-style video learning experience that challenges us all to do better at helping others. It will help you, your family, and your LIFE Group gain a new perspective on the most effective ways to help those in need--around the world and in our communities.</p>

      <p>Together, let's do better at doing good.</p>
